# Auto Skip Ad Safari ⏩

A lightweight Safari Web Extension designed to enhance your video viewing experience by automatically clicking the "Skip" button when it becomes available.

## Philosophy ⚖️

We believe in a fair and sustainable web. Advertisements are a crucial part of the internet ecosystem, allowing creators to continue providing free, high-quality content. However, when platforms offer a "Skip Ad" option, it is a built-in feature designed to be used.

**Auto Skip Ad Safari** simply automates that click for you. It doesn't block ads; it just saves you the manual effort of waiting with your cursor over the button. Use it responsibly and consider supporting your favorite creators directly!

## How it works 🛠️

- **Smart Scanning**: The extension scans the video player every 5 seconds.
- **Selective Action**: It looks for specific "Skip" buttons (YouTube, Vimeo, Dailymotion).
- **Automation**: If the button is visible and clickable, the extension triggers the click event instantly.
- **Native Experience**: Built as a native Safari Web Extension for maximum performance and minimum battery impact.

## Installation (for Developers) 💻

1. **Clone the repository**.
2. **Open the project**: Open `SkipAdApp/Auto Skip Ad Safari/Auto Skip Ad Safari.xcodeproj` in Xcode.
3. **Sign the App**: In the "Signing & Capabilities" tab, select your Development Team.

## Why Safari? 🍎

Unlike many Chrome-based extensions that consume significant RAM, this extension is optimized for macOS, ensuring your browsing remains fast and your MacBook's battery lasts longer.
